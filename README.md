The inefficiency of traditional medical appointment scheduling is what our project seeks to
address. The goal is to create a comprehensive, web-based platform that makes it easier for
patients and doctors to connect. It tackles the issue of patients' inability to locate appropriate
physicians, check their availability and schedule appointments. A process that frequently
necessitates manual phone calls and lengthy wait times.
A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) application is our solution,
offering a smooth, intuitive user interface to all parties involved. Three main modules comprise
the main features:
1. Patient Module: In addition to viewing thorough doctor profiles, patients can register, log in
and search for doctors by name or speciality. After that, they can choose a time slot that works
for them and schedule an appointment, which includes an integrated online payment system.
Additionally, patients will have a personal dashboard where they can manage their profile, view
their upcoming appointments and cancel reservations.
2. Doctor Module: To manage their schedules, see their list of forthcoming appointments, and
update their professional profile information, doctors will have access to a separate, secure
dashboard.
3. Admin Module: Complete platform management will be possible through a secure admin
panel, which will also allow for the addition and verification of new physicians, user account
management, and the viewing and management of all system appointments.
A comprehensive, end-to-end solution for contemporary healthcare appointment management
will be provided by this project.
